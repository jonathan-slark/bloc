## Introduction

`bloc` is based on a well-known game. This version sticks to fairly standard gameplay, but the scoring system is my own. The game was created as an exercise to learn games programming and is not meant to pose as an official version.

### Quick Start Guide

- **Up arrow** - Rotate
- **Left arrow** - Move left
- **Right arrow** - Move right
- **Down arrow** - Soft drop
- **Space bar** - Hard drop
- **Escape** - Quit

For more information on the gameplay, select the *Instructions* item in the game's menu. To navigate the menus, use the arrow keys and select an item with the *Return* key.

### Running the Game

To start `bloc` on Windows, extract all the files to a directory and run `bloc.exe`.

## Notes

- If you want to reset the high scores, simply delete `scores.txt`.
- If the game doesn't start or stops unexpectedly, check if `stderr.txt` existsâ€”it may contain an error message.
